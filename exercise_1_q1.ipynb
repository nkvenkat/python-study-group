    "<p>Python <b><i>reduce(function(), args)</i></b> function works by sequentially processing args using the passed in parameter function(). Initially reduce accepts the first two arguments from the input list and processes them for a result. This result is then combined with the next argument in sequence. The process continues until all arguments have been iterated over. The final result is returned.</p>"

    "<p>Given an input number, list of integers less than or equal to the input was generated. Python <i><b>reduce</b></i> function was used to compute successive, cumulative products, generating factorial as result. Use of try-catch block to trap user input was demonstrated; this is inline with popular coding standard that encourages minimal scaffolding."
